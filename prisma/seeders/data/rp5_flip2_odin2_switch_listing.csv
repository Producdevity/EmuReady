Freezes are infrequent, but not impossible. 3. Docked mode, 1x resolution. The least stable, but most impressive graphics. 1080p and 10-chunk render distance.

Minecraft: Nintendo Switch Edition (legacy Console),Perfect,Turnip 24.3.0 9v2,Sudachi,1.0.16,"There are 3 different configurations I found that have advantages and disadvantages. 1.

Perfect 60fps, extremely rarely freezes (but there is auto-save every minute or so, so don’t worry). 2. Docked mode, 0.75x resolution. Less stable, but gives a 810p resolution (not a typo, it is actually 810p) and has a 10-chunk render distance. Gameplay is almost always at 60fps, with rare dips to 55 or so. Freezes are infrequent, but not impossible. 3. Docked mode, 1x resolution. The least stable, but most impressive graphics. 1080p and 10-chunk render distance. Performance is also almost always at 60fps, but freezes are pretty common, maybe every 10-15 minutes or so. Also, make sure you use Turnip Driver 9v2 AND cubeb audio.
