# Webhook Troubleshooting Guide

This guide helps you debug issues where users are created in Clerk but not in your database.

## Quick Diagnostics

### 1. Check Environment Variables

Ensure you have the required environment variables set in your `.env` or `.env.local` file:

```bash
# Check if CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET is set
echo "CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET: ${CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET:+SET}"

# If not set, you need to get it from Clerk dashboard
```

### 2. Check Webhook Configuration in Clerk Dashboard

1. Go to your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/)
2. Navigate to **Webhooks** in the left sidebar
3. Verify you have a webhook configured with:
   - **Endpoint URL**: `https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/clerk`
   - **Events**: `user.created`, `user.updated`, `user.deleted`
   - **Status**: Active (green checkmark)

### 3. Check Server Logs

Look for webhook-related logs in your application console. The enhanced webhook route now logs:

- üîó When webhooks are received
- üì• Header validation status
- ‚úÖ Signature verification success
- üë§ User creation attempts
- ‚ùå Any errors with detailed information

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Missing CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET

**Symptoms:**

- Console shows: `‚ùå Missing CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET environment variable`
- Webhook returns 500 status

**Solution:**

1. Go to Clerk Dashboard ‚Üí Webhooks
2. Click on your webhook endpoint
3. Copy the "Signing Secret"
4. Add to your `.env.local`:
   ```
   CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_secret_here
   ```
5. Restart your development server

### Issue 2: Webhook Endpoint Not Accessible

**Symptoms:**

- No webhook logs in console
- Clerk shows failed webhook attempts in dashboard

**Solution:**
For local development, you need to expose your local server:

#### Option A: Using ngrok (Recommended for testing)

```bash
# Install ngrok if you haven't already
npm install -g ngrok

# Expose your local server (assuming port 3000)
ngrok http 3000

# Copy the HTTPS URL (e.g., https://abc123.ngrok.io)
# Update your Clerk webhook endpoint to:
# https://abc123.ngrok.io/api/webhooks/clerk
```

#### Option B: Using Cloudflare Tunnel (For persistent setup)

Follow the guide in `docs/AUTHENTICATION_SETUP.md`

### Issue 3: Signature Verification Failed

**Symptoms:**

- Console shows: `‚ùå Webhook verification failed`
- Webhook returns 400 status

**Solution:**

1. Verify the `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` matches exactly with Clerk dashboard
2. Ensure there are no extra spaces or characters
3. Make sure the webhook endpoint URL in Clerk matches your actual endpoint

### Issue 4: Database Connection Issues

**Symptoms:**

- Console shows: `‚ùå Failed to create user in database`
- Database errors in the detailed error output

**Solution:**

1. Check your database connection:
   ```bash
   # Test database connection
   npx prisma db pull
   ```
2. Ensure your database schema is up to date:
   ```bash
   npx prisma db push
   ```
3. Check if the `User` table exists and has the correct schema

### Issue 5: Email Address Issues

**Symptoms:**

- Console shows: `‚ùå No primary email found for user`
- Lists available emails but none match expected format

**Solution:**
This usually indicates a change in Clerk's webhook payload format. Check:

1. The webhook payload structure in Clerk documentation
2. Update the `primaryEmail` finding logic if needed

## Testing Your Webhook

### Manual Test via Clerk Dashboard

1. Go to Clerk Dashboard ‚Üí Webhooks
2. Click on your webhook
3. Click "Send Test Event"
4. Select "user.created" event
5. Check your server logs for the test event processing

### Create a Test User

1. Open your app in incognito/private mode
2. Sign up with a new test email
3. Watch the server console for webhook logs
4. Check your database to see if the user was created:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM "User" ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC LIMIT 5;
   ```

## Debugging Checklist

- [ ] `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variable is set
- [ ] Webhook endpoint is accessible from internet (for production) or via tunnel (for development)
- [ ] Webhook is configured in Clerk dashboard with correct URL
- [ ] Webhook is subscribed to `user.created`, `user.updated`, and `user.deleted` events
- [ ] Database connection is working
- [ ] Prisma schema is up to date (`npx prisma db push`)
- [ ] Server logs show webhook events being received
- [ ] No errors in webhook processing logs

## Getting Help

If you're still experiencing issues:

1. **Check the enhanced logs** - The webhook route now provides detailed logging
2. **Test with a simple case** - Try creating a user with a basic email
3. **Verify each step** - Go through this checklist systematically
4. **Check Clerk status** - Visit [Clerk Status Page](https://status.clerk.com/) for any service issues

## Production Considerations

- Ensure webhook endpoints use HTTPS
- Set up proper error monitoring (Sentry, LogRocket, etc.)
- Consider webhook retry logic for failed attempts
- Monitor webhook performance and response times
- Set up alerts for webhook failures
