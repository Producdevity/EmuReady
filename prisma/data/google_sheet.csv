Tried several drivers, got the best framerate with 25.2.0_R2. Framerate is typically directly tied to the number of entities on-screen, with the world map usually being 50-60fps, battle maps being about 45, and 6v6 combat screens dipping down to 30fps. Being a tactical RPG, this really isn't a problem, and feels great to play. Running in Handheld mode, with 0.75 resolution and FidelityFX. Cache, Max clocks, and Async Shaders turned on, CPU accuracy auto/graphics accuracy normal. May sometimes get the odd audio crackle, this can be fixed by switching audio to cubeb, but isn't really necessary.","Completed the game","","","5dde817c-185c-4565-8195-4a08950dd20b","","",""

Drop down to 960x544 for a little more framerate stability if desired. Freeroaming is usually between 40-60fps. Firefights can hover around 30fps.

Graphics driver version doesn't appear to be very important.
DX Wrapper must be DXVK versions 1.10.3 or less, anything newer will cause a DirectX error.
Any version of Box64 seems to work, I use 0.3.2.
Set box64 preset to performance for better fps.

If the game doesn't run for you, try these steps in this order:
1. In the Winlator settings for your game's shortcut, open the Advanced tab and scroll down to "Exec Arguments." Put in "/failsafe" without the quotes. If the game boots up, remember to remove this arg before next launch.
2. In your container's start menu look for a DirectX 2010 installer (in Frost it's in Start > Install > Install DX June 2010)
3. Install the Visual C++ Redistributable 2010 (some versions of Winlator have an installer in the start menu, otherwise download from Microsoft.)

Hopefully by this point the game is running for you.","394bea9a-cd3e-42ff-b75f-e229448a4c24","",""
