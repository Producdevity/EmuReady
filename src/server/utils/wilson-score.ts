/**
 * Calculate Wilson Score for confidence-weighted sorting
 * Modified version that's less conservative than standard Wilson Score
 *
 * - 2 up, 0 down → ~95% (not 34% like standard Wilson)
 * - But still handle edge cases properly
 *
 * @param upvotes Number of positive votes
 * @param downvotes Number of negative votes
 * @returns Score between 0 and 1, with 0.5 being neutral (no votes)
 *
 * Examples:
 * - 0 votes → 0.5 (neutral)
 * - 0 up, 2 down → ~0.05 (very bad)
 * - 2 up, 0 down → ~0.95 (good with low confidence)
 * - 10 up, 0 down → ~0.96 (great with high confidence)
 * - 100 up, 0 down → ~0.98 (excellent with very high confidence)
